2. Find the downloaded zipped file on your pc and **extract it**.
3. Install `nodejs` and `NPM` in your local system.
4. Open the Root Directory, navigate to SimpleWeb using the command `cd SimpleWeb` and use either `npm install` or `pnpm install` to install all dependencies.
5. Run `pnpm dev` or `npm start`.

#### Second, here is by using **Docker**.

1. Click on the green **Clone or download** button and choose Download ZIP.
2. Find the downloaded zipped file on your pc and **extract it**.
3. Then install `Docker` in your local system.
4. Run that command.
   `docker-compose up -d`.
5. You can now open the **frontend** at `localhost:3000`.

Once you are done you can close 🔒 the application in your terminal to quit the application.
